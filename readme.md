# Cook County Medical Examiner Database with Applied Improvements in Data Integrity

This project is a hobby of the owner of this GitHub.  I take it seriously, but additionally, I am human.

Notes herein are made to make the "database" more accessible to laypeople and other individuals interested in learning more about the data available to the public that is generated from the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

What is available in this project?
- My rendition of the Cook County Medical Examiner's Medical Examiner Case Archive which is also publicly available in its native format from the Cook County Open Data Portal.

- A "demise crosswalk" so that if you're looking for the long-form death certificate "cause of death," you can find it there.  The cause of death on my own rendition has been tailored for easier bucketing.

What am I working on currently?
- Zip code correction.  It's bad folks, really, it is.

- Daily updates.  Cross-reference for new cases and manner of death dispositions against pending cases are made daily when the Medical Examiner's native copy provides updates.

Thanks, Kari
